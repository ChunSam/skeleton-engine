# Security Hardening Notes - 2026-05

This note records the security and memory-safety hardening work from the May 2026 review.

## Completed

- Guarded the egui render path against custom paint callbacks before entering the internal unsafe render-pass helper. Callback primitives are skipped with a warning because the current `egui-wgpu` API requires a `'static` render pass lifetime.
- Added bounded inbound network event buffering with `NetworkConfig::max_pending_events` and `NetworkEvent::ReceiveQueueFull`.
- Updated the native websocket stack from `tungstenite 0.21` to `0.29`, which moves TLS verification to `rustls-webpki 0.103.13`.
- Updated the multiplayer server example for the `tungstenite 0.29` `Utf8Bytes` message API.
- Hardened `PathGrid` construction and indexing against negative sizes, integer overflow, and oversized allocations.
- Hardened `TilemapAtlas::uv_for` so zero-sized atlas grids return `UvRect::FULL` instead of panicking.
- Removed the redundant manual `unsafe impl Send/Sync for BehaviorTree`; the `BehaviorNode: Send + Sync` trait bound already guarantees thread-safety, and the hand-written impl would have silently masked unsoundness if that bound were ever relaxed.
- Repaired the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` build, which had regressed because the WebSocket `wasm_impl` module called `push_event_bounded` without importing it (native builds were unaffected).

## Verification

- `cargo check`
- `cargo test`
- `cargo tree -i rustls-webpki` confirms `rustls-webpki v0.103.13`.
- OSV batch query no longer reports the previous `rustls-webpki` advisories.

## Remaining Risk — accepted / not scheduled

> Status (2026-05-29): the dependency security follow-up was **removed from planned work**
> during the vision reset (`docs/VISION.md`). These advisories are **acknowledged and
> accepted as known risk**, not actively scheduled. They are recorded here (not deleted)
> because the underlying advisories still exist; revisit if one becomes exploitable in
> practice or during a deliberate renderer/`wgpu` upgrade.

- ~~`glyphon 0.6.0` still depends on `lru 0.12.5`, which is affected by `RUSTSEC-2026-0002`.~~
  **RESOLVED (2026-06-12, v7.0.0)**: the renderer dependency migration anticipated below
  shipped — wgpu 22 → 29 / glyphon 0.6 → 0.11 / egui 0.29 → 0.34. `lru` now resolves to
  `0.16.4` (≥ 0.16.3), confirmed in `Cargo.lock`; `RUSTSEC-2026-0002` no longer applies.
  See `docs/CHANGELOG.md` `## 7.0.0`.
- ~~`lru >= 0.16.3` cannot be resolved under the current `glyphon 0.6` requirement.~~ (same — resolved by the v7.0.0 migration)
- ~~`glyphon 0.10+` moves to newer `wgpu` major versions, so fully removing this advisory should be handled as a separate renderer dependency migration.~~ (done in v7.0.0)
- `paste 1.0.15` remains reported as unmaintained via transitive dependencies; this is not an active vulnerability but should be monitored during future dependency upgrades.
