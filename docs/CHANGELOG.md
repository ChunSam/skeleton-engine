# Changelog

All notable changes to `skeleton-engine` are documented here.

The package follows semantic versioning beginning with 1.0.0.

## Unreleased

### Added

- 2D cutout (rigged) skeletal animation in `src/skeletal.rs`: `SkeletalAnimator`,
  `SkeletalClip`, `BoneTrack`, `BoneKeyframe`, `SkeletalAnimationSystem`, and the
  `SkeletonBuilder` authoring helper. Bones are hierarchy entities whose local
  `Transform` is keyframed; the existing `HierarchySystem` and sprite renderer draw them
  with no renderer changes. See `docs/SKELETAL.md` and `examples/skeletal_puppet.rs`.
- Re-exported `AssetId`, `SaveKey`, `save_with_key`, and `load_with_key` from the crate root so public examples match the stable API surface.
- Added `ScheduleErrorPolicy` and `SystemPanicPolicy` so apps can opt into stricter schedule-cycle and system-panic behavior while keeping the existing fallback defaults.
- Added `examples/runtime_policies.rs` to show strict runtime policy configuration without opening a long-running window.
- Added `World::mark_changed<T>()` and `World::get_mut_tracked<T>()` for explicit ECS change tracking after direct component mutation.
- Added native `AudioChannelState` plus `AudioManager::playback_state`, `is_finished`, and `is_playing` so games can advance non-looping playlists when a channel naturally drains.
- Added `docs/ENTITY_GENERATION_V2_PLAN.md` to lock the v2 design for generation-checked entity handles.

### Changed

- `HierarchySystem` now propagates `GlobalTransform` in topological (root→child) order in a
  single pass, supporting arbitrary hierarchy depth. It previously ran a fixed 2-pass loop
  capped at depth 3 — a limit surfaced by deep skeletal bone chains.
- Aligned save encryption and async asset examples in the public reference with the current source.
- Native `AssetServer` cache keys now canonicalize existing file paths, reducing duplicate handles and hot-reload misses caused by mixed relative/absolute paths. Missing paths and WASM URLs keep their existing string behavior.
- Sprite renderer file texture cache lookups now accept both the original requested path and the canonical `AssetServer` handle path, so `Sprite::textured_with_handle(...)`, `DrawImage::textured_with_handle(...)`, and atlas textures no longer fall back to white when images are loaded through relative paths.
- Native audio decoding now enables MP3 in addition to WAV and Vorbis/OGG.
- `PhysicsSystem` now documents the physics-unit to pixel-unit boundary and defensively clamps invalid `pixels_per_unit` values in release builds while asserting in debug builds.
- Clarified that Rhai scripting is intended for trusted local game code, not hostile sandboxing, and documented the limits of temporary script spawn IDs.
- **Breaking rendering behavior fix:** fixed the default sprite quad UV orientation so `Sprite`, `DrawImage`, `AtlasSprite`,
  `UvRect::FULL`, `UvRect::from_grid(...)`, and `UvRect::from_pixels(...)` render
  normal top-left-origin PNGs upright without requiring `UvRect::flipped_y()`.
  Existing game-side `.flipped_y()` orientation workarounds should be removed after
  updating the engine.

### Fixed

- Restored the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` build: the WebSocket `wasm_impl` module called
  `push_event_bounded` unqualified without importing it, breaking the wasm target while the
  native build was unaffected. The function is now imported into the module scope.
- Removed the redundant manual `unsafe impl Send/Sync for BehaviorTree`. The
  `BehaviorNode: Send + Sync` trait bound already guarantees both, so the hand-written impl
  was unnecessary and would have silently masked unsoundness if that bound were ever relaxed.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-27

### Added

- Stable `skeleton-engine` package metadata with library crate name `engine`.
- Rust 1.88 minimum supported Rust version declaration.
- README, MIT license, changelog, and beginner `examples/basic.rs`.
- CI gates for formatting, clippy, full native tests, release build, WASM build, rustdoc warnings, `cargo package`, and `cargo publish --dry-run`.

### Changed

- Documented release package hygiene with an explicit crates.io include list.
- Updated public documentation examples for current `OffscreenCamera`, `Sprite`, `TouchState`, and `glam::Vec2` usage.
